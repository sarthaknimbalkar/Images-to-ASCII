# ASCII Art Converter

This Python script converts an image into ASCII art. It resizes the image, converts it to grayscale, and maps pixel intensity to ASCII characters to create the ASCII art representation.

## Features

- Converts images to ASCII art.
- Supports various input image formats.
- Flexible scaling options.
- Saves ASCII art to a text file.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sarthaknimbalkar/Images-to-ASCII.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install Pillow
    ```

3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python image_to_ascii.py
    ```

    Replace `<input_image_path>` with the path to the input image, `<output_type>` with the desired output type (e.g., "txt" for text file), `<output_path>` with the path where you want to save the ASCII art, and `<scale>` with the scaling factor for resizing the image.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow (Python Imaging Library)
